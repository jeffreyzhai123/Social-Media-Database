# Social Media & Market Platform Project

## Project Introduction
This project simulates an integrated social media platform, 
supporting both community-based communication online and commercial activities.
We aim to create an application in which users can:

- Greet others and form communities by posting contents;
- Engage in hot topics and sponsored community activities;
- Earn points from activities and exchange for merchandise;

We also grant users the right to look at some statistics of the database, 
offering them a glance of the overall situation and trends of the whole system.
